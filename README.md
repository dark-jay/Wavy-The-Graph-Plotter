# Wavy-The-Graph-Plotter

## About:
It is simple graph plotter program written in c# and c++. This program is the working example of how one can use the power of Mathematical String Parser (my other repo.). Mathematical String Parser engine was written in c++.

## IDE:
Visual Studio 2015

## Working:
Interface and the plotting function is written in c#. The Mathematical String Parser is written in c++ and i combined both of them by creating CLR library.

## Limitations:
Since this is just a demonstration program, there is so much limitation like, plotting and grid class is not optimized, this program cannot handle cicle equation, but with little tweaking it is possible, but i dont have that much of time to do that since this is just a showcase of use of Mathematical String Parser (my other repo.).
